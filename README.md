# VoxelNet_FinalProj
Final Project for a Geometric and Deep Computer Vision class that implements VoxelNet

**Note:** This project is originally based on the research paper [VoxelNet: End-toEnd Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06396)
and borrows some assets and code from [VoxelNet-tensorflow](https://github.com/tsinghua-rll/VoxelNet-tensorflow) 
by [jeasinema](https://github.com/jeasinema).
